# Changelog

[简体中文](CHANGELOG.md) | **English**

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Backup, structure, and editable-project
formats may still evolve during Beta; incompatible changes must include migration notes.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Versioned real-photo evaluation protocol covering rights, retention, SHA-256, scene
  tags, aggregate gates, and JSON reports.
- `crochet2pattern-eval`, which evaluates only the local-vision path.
- `crochet2pattern-trials`, with pattern hashes, measured gauge/size/yarn/time, conservative
  calibration candidates, and separate calibration/holdout cohorts.
- Curated external trial evidence packaged with the wheel and prohibited from automatic calibration.
- MIT license, contribution/security/conduct policies, structured issue forms, and a PR template.
- Full English entry points for user, contributor, security, evidence, and status documentation.

### Changed

- README now separates structural correctness, photo generalization, and physical crochetability.
- Secret checks cover staged untracked files and common GitHub, AWS, and private-key patterns.
- Core tests no longer rely on the optional PDF extra; Streamlit tests use stable absolute paths.
- Weekly and lock-change dependency auditing now tests the environment installed from `uv.lock`.
- CI forces each declared interpreter through `UV_PYTHON`, preventing a false matrix that
  silently reused the local default.
- GitHub Actions use `checkout@v7` and `setup-python@v7`.
- Pose is limited to Python 3.11–3.12 and upgraded to MediaPipe 1.0.1, removing the old
  vulnerable `protobuf<5` constraint. Every core environment uses Protobuf 6+; Python
  3.13+ also uses NumPy 2.x.
- Dependency security installs and audits core, PDF, and pose extras together.
- Linux pose checks for EGL/GLESv2 before constructing MediaPipe objects and safely
  falls back when missing; extras CI installs the runtime and exercises the real image bridge.

### Planned

- Collect an authorized real-photo baseline and an independent physical-trial baseline.
- Split the largest parameter-generation, result-rendering, grid, and provider-adapter modules.
- Publish the first Beta tag only after the G3 and G4 evidence gates pass.

## 0.2.0-beta.1 - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Provider-independent single-image observations, user target-size transforms, and
  StructureGeometry v2.
- Part instances, mirrored quantities, attachment anchors, assembly plans, and multiplicity-aware totals.
- Gauge-driven shaping limits, round arithmetic, six-section topology, and V/A executability checks.
- Profile shaping, ideal sphere/egg heads, one-piece head/body, and advanced structure correction.
- Pre-generation crop, grid editing, undo/redo, editable project JSON, and complete Markdown export.
- CLI, SQLite history, share links, PDF export, ring charts, and versioned backup validation.

### Changed

- Minimum Python is 3.11; CI covers Python 3.11–3.14.
- Yarn matching uses a real palette and CIEDE2000; imported grids must use trusted color names/RGB.
- Beta, single-image, estimate, and physical-test boundaries are explicit.

### Security

- Uploaded images, share payloads, backups, structure JSON, and grid projects have size and schema gates.
- API key/relay sources are isolated, exceptions are redacted, and tracked files are scanned for secrets.
